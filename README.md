# LLMBroker

## Overview
LLMBroker is a decentralized platform that enables users to run large language model (LLM) inferences on idle computing hardware. By leveraging a distributed network of compute providers, LLMBroker connects those who need LLM services with those who have spare processing power, creating an efficient, cost-effective, and scalable solution.

## How It Works
LLMBroker consists of three core components:

### 1. LLMBroker Server
The LLMBroker Server allows users to earn money by running LLM inferences on their computers when they are idle. It acts as a RESTful API endpoint that processes inference requests and verifies them against smart contracts to ensure security and compliance.

### 2. Inference Agreement Smart Contracts
Smart contracts serve as a decentralized marketplace for LLM tokens. Users can purchase tokens to access compute resources, and providers receive tokens in exchange for fulfilling inference requests. This ensures a transparent and trustless transaction system.

### 3. LLMBroker NPM Package
The LLMBroker NPM package simplifies interaction with the smart contract marketplace. It abstracts token purchasing, server discovery, and request handling into an easy-to-use JavaScript library. This package is also integrated into the server code for seamless operation.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Compute Sharing** – Utilize idle GPUs and CPUs for LLM inference tasks.
- **Smart Contract Marketplace** – Secure and transparent token-based payment system.
- **Simple API Integration** – Easily connect to LLMBroker services using the NPM package.
- **Earn Passive Income** – Run LLM inferences and get rewarded for unused compute power.
- **Scalable & Cost-Effective** – Pay only for the compute you use, with no centralized overhead.

## Getting Started
- Clone the Endpoint directory and configure your chosen LLM (DeepseekR1 is used as default)
